    "# HMS SDMX Lab Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the HMS SDMX Lab Notebooks collection! These interactive notebooks demonstrate workflows for working with SDMX data and the FMR (Fusion Metadata Registry) system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. FMR Workflow Demo - Submit & Retrieve\n",
    "ðŸ“„ [fmr_workflow_demo_submit_retrieve.ipynb](./fmr_workflow_demo_submit_retrieve.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to:\n",
    "- Submit data and metadata to an FMR instance\n",
    "- Retrieve information from the registry\n",
    "- Handle authentication and API interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. FMR Workflow Demo - Validation (Sync & Async)\n",
    "ðŸ“„ [fmr_workflow_demo_validate_sync_async.ipynb](./fmr_workflow_demo_validate_sync_async.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- Synchronous and asynchronous validation workflows\n",
    "- Handling validation reports and error checking\n",
    "- Processing validation results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Important Note**: These notebooks run in your browser using JupyterLite and Pyodide. Some features may work differently than in a traditional Jupyter environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Authentication**: You'll need credentials for the HMS Lab instance to run the API examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dependencies**: The required Python packages (`requests`, `lxml`) are pre-installed in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Data Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks include several sample data files:\n",
    "- `example_dataflow.xml` - Sample dataflow definition\n",
    "- `example_data_pass.xml` - Valid data example\n",
    "- `example_data_fail.csv` - Invalid data example for testing validation\n",
    "- `provision_agreement.xml` - Sample provision agreement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utility Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `utils.py` module contains helper functions for:\n",
    "- Validation error checking\n",
    "- Report processing\n",
    "- Common API operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions about these notebooks or the HMS SDMX Lab, please refer to the HMS documentation or contact the HMS team.\n",
