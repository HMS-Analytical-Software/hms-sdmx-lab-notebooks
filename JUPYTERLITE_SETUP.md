# JupyterLite Setup Instructions

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your HMS SDMX Lab Notebooks are now configured for JupyterLite deployment on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Save the settings

### 2. Trigger Deployment
- Push your changes to the `main` branch
- GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your JupyterLite site
- The workflow typically takes 2-3 minutes to complete

### 3. Access Your Site
Once deployed, your notebooks will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as source
- [ ] All files are committed and pushed to the main branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully (check the "Actions" tab)
- [ ] Site is accessible at the GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] Notebooks load and run correctly in the browser

## 🛠 Local Testing (Optional)

To test the JupyterLite build locally:

```bash
# Install JupyterLite
pip install jupyterlite-core[all]

# Build the site
jupyter lite build --contents content --output-dir dist

# Serve locally
python -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## 📝 Notes

- **Pyodide Compatibility**: The `requirements-lite.txt` file contains packages that work with Pyodide (the Python runtime used by JupyterLite)
- **No Server Required**: JupyterLite runs entirely in the browser - no backend server needed
- **Automatic Updates**: Any changes pushed to main will automatically redeploy the site

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs in the "Actions" tab of your repository
2. Ensure all required files are present and properly formatted
3. Verify that GitHub Pages is correctly configured

## 🎉 Success!

Your HMS SDMX Lab Notebooks are now ready for the world to use! Users can access your interactive notebooks directly in their browsers without any installation required.
